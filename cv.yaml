      The JCU Credit Calculator offers students the ability to receive credit
      (advanced standing) for studies completed at other institutions. The
      previous version of this software was hard to use, required days of
      manual data entry by administrators and was inordinately expensive. The
      eResearch Centre built a modern React-based, fit-for-purpose tool that
      automatically integrates with other University systems, delivering a
      flowing, engaging user experience – built and delivered for less than a
      tenth of the cost of running the previous system for a single year.
