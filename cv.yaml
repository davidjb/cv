  summary: |
    David is a technologist, full-stack web developer and project manager, specialising in open source and customised applications. With a client-driven focus, David applies detailed knowledge of web technologies and IT security to his work: frontend/backend development, UI & UX design, system administration, operations and end-user support.

    His passions are users, accessibility, engaging user experiences (UX), open source, Python, JavaScript and Linux. His experience extends to various other languages and technologies, enthusiastically investigating and adapting to unseen (and challenging) IT environments.

    David's personal strengths are his attention to detail, adaptability and initiative, problem solving ability, ability to communicate  and professional integrity.  He believes in openness and honesty, advocating for users and fostering communities; he is an organiser of a regional developers' group and actively maintains/contributes to open source software.

    He once recovered a very expensive electron microscope by restoring an ancient Solaris hard drive bit-by-bit (literally), has hiked islands and the outback to install technology and programmed and debugged live underwater electronics.
